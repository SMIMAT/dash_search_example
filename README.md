# Dash Search Demo

A buildable Dash framework demonstrating a basic search function.


## Installation

Follow these steps:
  - Navigate to the usual directory you use for hosting repos on your computer.
  - type `git clone git@github.com:ch-robinson-internal/base-dash-framework.git <your_app_name_here>`
  - Navigate into this folder and work on your code from here. VS Code Remote Explorer is the easiest way to work with this

## Standing up the App

Once navigated into your folder, there are three easy options.
  - type `make dash` to stand up the Dash app on your VM at port 3000
  - type `make requirements` to install all necessary requirements on your computer.

## Modifying the framework

You are free to modify this as you wish. If you want to turn this into its own project, please start a new repo and push your modified code there. You will not be able to push any changes to this repo.

If you do not need any particular part of the app, there are instructions in main/app.py on how to remove the unnecessary components.
